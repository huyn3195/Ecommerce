# Ecommerce

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** MERN Stack, Redux, HTML, CSS, Heroku, Netlify

I used MongoDB as my Database, NodeJS and Express for my server and React for my frontend. I am hosting this app on Heroku (backend) and the frontend on Netlify. 

## Optimizations
Implement Redis caching to improve the loading speed and use optimized query calls.
Implement Redux to helps with state management and reuse state to help with the frontend side

## How to run:
**Start server:** 
1. nvm use node
2. npm i
3. cd to server
4. Create your own env. The env examples can provide you help.
5. npm run dev

**Start client side:**
- cd to client
- npm i
- npm run build
